      "Good news! You can stop guessing at how many calories you need to control your weight. When you guess at what you need, you are more likely to consume too few or too many calories, thereby preventing you from meeting your goal. That is frustrating and erodes confidence. Instead, use MyNetDiary to plan and track calories so that you meet your weight goal safely and effectively.",
